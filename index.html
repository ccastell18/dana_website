      <p>
        Dana Marie Richards, M.A., is a reiki master, spirit medium in
        training, intuitive healer, spiritual coach and shamanic practitioner.
        She fluidly integrates these modalities as a co creator in your own
        healing journey of mind, body and spirit. Dana Marie's spiritual
        curriculum began back in 2009, when a shaman healer told her that
        healing was to be her life's path. Since then, she has earned a
        Master's degree in Integrative Health Studies and Wellness Coaching,
        guided imagery certification, and certification as a Usui Reiki
        Master, She also discovered her divine gifts as a spirit medium and
        continues to be a dedicated student of channeling and women's
        empowerment based in the sacred knowledge of shamanic tradition.
        Inspired by her love of mind, body and spirit medicine, and her own
        healing journey, Dana Marie powerfully serves others by creating a
        sacred healing space to discover, shift, release, nourish, heal and
        lift your spirit to reach your highest potential.

              guide me towards where I need to explore within myself every

              at the precision and accuracy of the description of my great
              grandmother. She helped me to remember sides of her that I had
              forgotten. It was very soothing to receive her loving message to
              me and to be reminded that I am always surrounded by my
              ancestors who have passed. After our session, I felt very happy
              all day and I felt motivated to keep on with my writing
              endeavors. I'm so grateful for Dana's offerings."

              started once a week, to every other week, and then gradually to
              once a month, and only when I felt ready. I received everything
              all of her listed healing services, from Reiki, shamanic
              medicine work, crystal healing, and intuitive and spiritual
              healing/coaching. I believe all complimented each other for the
