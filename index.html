    <div class="text p-2">Reiki is a mind, body and spirit intervention that supports our overall health and
      acknowledges the person as a “whole”. Reiki is an ancient form of energy based medicine that originates
      from indigenous Tibetan practice. It’s name derives from Japanese terms Rei meaning universe or spirit and ki
      meaning energy. Reiki is a hands-on method that promotes healing by channeling the gentle life force energy from
      the practitioner to the client to rebalance and enhance the body’s inherent healing response. Reiki is considered
      a complimentary healing intervention that is not intended to take the place of allopathic medicine. It is apart of
      an integrative approach to healing and optimum health and wellness.</div>

              understanding of energy. Her unique intuitive ability helps to
              guide me towards where I need to explore within myself every
              time we meet. She is helping me deepen my spiritual practice and
              the work we are doing together is so healing and so fun. I am so
              grateful I manifested Dana into my life!"

              "The messages Dana delivered me were very healing. I was amazed
              at the precision and accuracy of the description of my great
              grandmother. She helped me to remember sides of her that I had
              forgotten. It was very soothing to receive her loving message to
              me and to be reminded that I am always surrounded by my
              ancestors who have passed. After our session, I felt very happy
              all day and I felt motivated to keep on with my writing
              endeavors. I'm so grateful for Dana's offerings."

              "In February 2017 I began my journey with Dana Marie. We first
              started once a week, to every other week, and then gradually to
              once a month, and only when I felt ready. I received everything
              all of her listed healing services, from Reiki, shamanic
              medicine work, crystal healing, and intuitive and spiritual
              healing/coaching. I believe all complimented each other for the
              most profound and magical results."
