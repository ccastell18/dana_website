# dana_website

This was my first public web site.  I made it for a friend who had a reiki business. I made it a simple HTML/CSS site.  I tried to incorporate new ways of design and implementing animations using CSS.  The email was sent directly to the profile on the hosting site.  The site just came down because she moved on to other careers, but I'm still proud of the work.  It was my first live site.
